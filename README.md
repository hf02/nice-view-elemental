## why

- i found the a bit hard to read, especially with it being narrow. so i got rid of all its class and style, and now it's just some plain text. the font is Pixel Operator
- the nice!view already has bezels, so we can use those as padding by getting rid of any padding on the screen panel itself. and now we got more screen space!
- i dont like animations, so we got the google turtle instead

## todo
- change the font of the profile indicator gaa
- put something on the left side on the central board. an image? wpm? i dunno!
